# X Automation App

A full-stack, AI-powered social media automation tool designed to help developers and content creators maintain a consistent and data-driven presence on **X (formerly Twitter)**.  

This application automates content creation, post scheduling, and provides actionable analytics.  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Users can securely log in with their X account via an **OAuth 2.0 flow**. A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is issued to protect all API endpoints.  

- **AI-Powered Content Generation**  
  Integrates with the **OpenRouter API** to generate unique and engaging tweet drafts based on trending keywords.  

- **Automated Post Scheduling**  
  A background **cron job** automatically publishes scheduled posts to the user's X account at their preferred times.  

- **Trends & Analytics**  
  Uses **Google Trends** data to provide insights into rising and top-related queries for a given keyword, helping users identify content opportunities.  

- **User Preferences**  
  Users can set a preferred posting time, which the app uses to automatically schedule content without manual input.
